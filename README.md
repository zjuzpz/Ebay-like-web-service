# Ebay-like-web-service
This is a full-stack Java web application. <br>
In the project, I built a Web service and a web site that allow users to search and navigate eBay bidding data.<br>
The system manages all of its data at the back-end in the mySQL database and supports browing and searching interfaces over the
Internet. These functionalities are provided by integrating MySQL, Apache Tomcat, Lucene and Axis2 packages.
